  YARD Notes

summary:
  Because some tags are for project developers, not API users.

description:
  Normally YARD emits a warning about unrecongnized decoumentaiton tags
  and omits them from output. With YARD Notes, all caps tags will still
  be omitted from the docs, but will be added to a special NOTES file of
  the documentation.
